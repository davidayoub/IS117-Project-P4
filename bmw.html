          <h1> BMW</h1>
          <p>When it comes to high performance luxury cars, few do it better than BMW. <br>The German firm’s modern cars are classy, luxurious, and quick. However, it’s the models with the coveted ‘M’ badge that take the cake in terms of performance. From small coupes to big four-door SUVs, BMW motorsport division has taken already incredible cars and made them track monsters. <br>In the sedan model, the 2 series is a two-door coupe and convertible that is smallest in size and lowest in price. The 3 series is a four-door compact sedan available as a sports wagon (Touring) or slightly larger Gran Turismo. The 4 series is a  compact two-door coupe also available as a convertible or as a four-door Gran Coupe. You may have seen a 5 series sedan labeled as a 530i, 540i, or an M550i. In general, the larger the last two digits in the number, the more powerful the engine performs. For instance, a 540i will be more powerful than a 530i. While these numbers were originally linked to engine size, they now represent general power. </p>
